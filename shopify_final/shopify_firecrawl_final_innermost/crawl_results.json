          "description": "Get your glow up. Better self-care involves addressing it from different angles, including your nutrition. The Glow Blend contains a science-backed combination of the most effective ingredients to nourish your skin, hair and nails including hydrolysed collagen peptides, hyaluronic acid, biotin, folate and vitamin C. Developed to promote skin elasticity, smooth appearance, increase radiance, while strengthening you hair and nails. It’s time to get your glow. Per Serving: Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (6g): The most abundant protein in your body and the major component of the connective tissues found in your skin, hair and nails. As we age, collagen levels fall, which can result in a decrease in your skin’s structural integrity. References > 1, 2. Hyaluronic Acid (100mg): Skin ageing is commonly associated with loss of skin moisture. Hyaluronic acid has a unique ability to bind and retain water molecules. This ingredient can be found increasingly in skincare products where it offers multi-depth skin hydration and helps maintain dermal moisture. The result? Plumper looking skin that appears firmer with visibly less wrinkles. References > 3, 4. Vitamin C (160mg): Vitamin C stimulates the body’s natural ability to make collagen as well as acting as a potent antioxidant that protects against UV damage. Supplementing with vitamin C is especially important as you age and your body’s natural collagen production slows down. References > 5, 6. Biotin (2,500µg): Biotin, often hailed as the “beauty vitamin,” helps support the production of keratin — a key protein in hair, skin, and nails. It also helps your body convert food into energy supporting the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbs. Supplementing with biotin can be especially beneficial if you have brittle nails, thinning hair, or during pregnancy. References > 7, 8. Folate (200µg): Folate is often linked to pregnancy health, but it’s vital for everyone. Folate contributes to cell renewal, helping your skin look fresher and more radiant. It also helps your body make DNA and red blood cells, supporting energy levels and a healthy immune system. References > 9, 10.

          "description": "Get lean the right way. Our protein blends won’t make you bulky. This one was actually crafted to help you slim-down. We want to make it easier to reach your ideal weight so we packed it with ingredients to support fat metabolism. Formulated to encourage healthy fat-loss, reduce cravings, and maintain energy levels. A smarter way to lean-up. Per Serving: Protein (31g): The building block of bones, muscles, hair, skin, and nails, this blend of dairy-based whey concentrate and isolate contains all the essential amino acids your body needs for repair, recovery and muscle development. References >1, 2. Inulin (1g): Advanced research in weight management emphasises recognising the importance of our gut as a metabolic organ. Inulin is a prebiotic fibre that encourages growth of good gut bacteria linked to lower levels of fat. References > 3, 4. Acetyl L-Carnitine (750mg): A non-essential amino acid necessary for transporting fat to the body’s power-generating mitochondria. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to use fat effectively as a source of energy, which could result in the body having to break down muscle instead. References > 5, 6. Pomegranates (500mg): This fruit has sparked interest in recent years largely due to its punicalagin and ellagic acid content. These compounds are retained in the gut where they encourage the growth of good gut bacteria linked to lower levels of fat. References > 7, 8. Yerba Mate (500mg): Dried leaves of an evergreen holly tree native to South America. An incredibly high antioxidant content and has been shown to have possible effects in the area of weight management, which could be due to it helping delay intestinal absorption of dietary fat. References > 9, 10. Bilberries (200mg): Belonging to a class of natural bioactives with wide-reaching health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, glucose control and inflammation. These dark berries are rich in antioxidants and resveratrol, which are seeing increased use for their purported anti-aging properties. References > 11, 12. Active Ingredients For every serving of The Lean Protein: Protein (31g), Inulin (1g), Acetyl L-Carnitine (750mg), Pomegranates (500mg), Yerba Mate (500mg), Bilberries (200mg). Scroll down to learn about these ingredients and how they benefit you. This product is vegetarian, cruelty free, gluten free, soy free, halal, suitable for kosher diets, non-GMO, and free from most major allergens. Furthermore, the product contains no artificial flavours, fillers, bulking agents or colours. The protein in this product is sourced from whey (milk); a complete source of protein containing all the amino acids your body needs. We've added guar gum, which is a GMO-free, gluten-free, natural fibre that comes from the guar bean to give our shakes a creamy texture. We use sunflower lecithin instead of soy lecithin, which is the only kind of lecithin that can be obtained raw and chemical-free using a cold press system similar to that used with olive oil. We also add some sweetness to the product by adding a tiny bit of sucralose, which is the most widely tested low-calorie sweetener and approved by all food standard agencies in the world.

          "description": "Elevate your energy. We set out to create the most effective pre-workout with added BCAAs on the market. One that wasn’t packed with crazy amounts of caffeine. Did we succeed? It's won a bunch of Best Pre-workout Awards, so yeah. Formulated to raise energy, improve stamina and to help push yourself further. Activate your superpowers. Per Serving: BCAA Complex (5g): Of the twenty amino acids, nine are considered essential amino acids, meaning they must be obtained through your diet. Three of these nine are called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): leucine, isoleucine and valine. These are the most important amino acids for muscle growth and maintenance. You can find them here in an optimal 2:1:1 ratio. References > 1, 2. Citrulline Malate (2g): This is L-Citrulline (an amino acid) combined with malic acid (an organic salt). Citrulline malate can improve aerobic and anaerobic performance during prolonged exercise by reducing fatigue and increasing nitric oxide in the body. This relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow and oxygen to working muscles. References > 3, 4. Maca (1.25g): Reduces effects of physical and mental stress, and increases energy and libido. Grown for more than 2,000 years in the highest mountains of Peru, maca has recently found widespread popularity as an adaptogen. These are a group of natural ingredients that support the body's ability to deal with stress. References > 5, 6. Beta Alanine (1.2g): When you exercise, metabolites accumulate in the muscles causing pH levels to drop resulting in fatigue. Carnosine can help reduce this acidity but the amount of carnosine made in the body depends on the amount of beta alanine available, and it's only when there's excess beta alanine that carnosine levels can increase to offset fatigue and aid performance. References > 7, 8. Guarana (100mg): An Amazonian fruit regarded as the elixir of long life. In addition to the stimulating action of its caffeine content, other benefits have been attributed to it’s alkaloid content. These include improved alertness, reaction time, memory, mood and performance during physical exercise. References > 9, 10. Caffeine (71mg): The value of caffeine on mental and physical performance has been well-established. Research evidences positive effects on improving alertness, mood, cognitive function, fat oxidation, and exercise performance. References > 11, 12. Vitamin B Complex (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12 all at 100%*): For reduction of tiredness and fatigue. They also play a role in maintaining hair and skin health, and regulating the nervous system. There are eight essential B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, biotin, folic acid and vitamin B12. We bring all eight together at each one's daily recommended intake. References > 13, 14. *%NRV (Nutrient Reference Values) are guidelines on daily amounts of vitamins and minerals to be consumed to maintain a healthy diet.

          "description": "Definition done properly. To decrease body fat you need the right nutrients. That's where this product comes in. Acetyl-l-carnitine is the most popular non-stimulant fat-loss supplement in the world. Combined with vitamins B6 and B12, the product works by ensuring your body is metabolising fat efficiently. A helping hand to optimal fat-loss. Per Serving: Acetyl L-Carnitine (2g): One of the most popular non-stimulant fat-loss supplements on the market today. A non-essential amino acid found naturally in the human body, necessary for transporting fat to the body’s power-generating mitochondria for use as energy during physical activity. Without carnitine, we wouldn’t be able to use fat effectively as a source of energy, which could result in the body having to break down muscle instead. The key benefit of the acetyl form of carnitine is that it can cross the blood-brain barrier to improve mood, learning and memory as well. References > 1, 2. Vitamin B6 (1.4mg, 100%*) and Vitamin B12 (2.5µg, 100%*): For the reduction of tiredness and fatigue and normal energy-yielding metabolism. These also play a role in maintaining hair and skin health, and a regulated nervous system. Allergens: None.

This product is vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, lactose free, soy free, halal, suitable for kosher diets, non-GMO, and free from all 14 major allergens. Furthermore, the product contains natural flavours only with no artificial fillers, bulking agents or colours. We use a tiny amount of sucralose to add a little sweetness to the product. Sucralose is the safest and most widely tested zero-calorie sweetener on the market and approved by all food standard agencies in the world. How And When To Use To be taken during the day, once a day. Directions: Mix 2g (1 flat teaspoon) with around 250ml of cold water and stir until dissolved.

These daily nootropic capsules contain research-backed ingredients that support the recovery process, reduce inflammation, and regulate hormone activity. Get back to doing what you do best. Per 2 Capsules: Maca (1g): Reduces effects of physical and mental stress, and increases energy and libido. Grown for more than 2,000 years in the highest mountains of Peru, maca has recently found widespread popularity as an adaptogen. These are a group of natural ingredients that support the body's ability to deal with stress. References > 1, 2. ZMA (150mg): A natural mineral supplement made up of an optimal balance of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Zinc plays a role in supporting normal testosterone levels. Magnesium plays a role in metabolism and muscle function. Vitamin B6 reduces tiredness and may help boost energy levels. References > 3, 4. Chocamine (60mg): A cocoa extract high in a group of natural bioactives called flavanols (in particular epicatechin, also found in dark chocolate). Studies have found that epicatechin reduced myostatin (a protein that inhibits muscle growth) and increased follistatin (a protein that promotes muscle growth) in the body. References > 5, 6. Ubiquinone CoQ10 (25mg): A nutrient essential for the optimal functioning of our mitochondria – the energy producing factories of our bodies. This vitamin-like compound is made in the body and used by our cells to produce energy for growth and repair. Research suggests that we don’t get enough of it and levels drop as we get older. References > 7, 8. Selenium (50ug): An essential trace mineral best known as an antioxidant needed for a strong immune system, and playing a role in male and female fertility. Research suggests that increased selenium intake may lead to reduced cancer risk. Selenium deficiency, notably in Western countries, is increasing the call for its supplementation. References > 9, 10. Vitamin D (1000IU, 500%*): Regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. While there are early suggestions that vitamin D supplementation could provide some protection against COVID-19, more trials are needed before this can be confirmed. Regardless, it would be a good idea to achieve your recommended daily intake given the overall health risks of vitamin D deficiency.

          "description": "You have the power. Save money with our Collections. All the products from our Strength range in a convenient bundle along with an Innermost Shaker Bottle. Use the dropdown below to choose your protein flavour. Per Serving: The Strong Protein: Protein (34g): The building block of bones, muscles, hair, skin, and nails, this blend of dairy-based whey concentrate and isolate contains all the essential amino acids your body needs for repair, recovery and muscle development. Casein: A slower-digesting protein that, when combined with faster-digesting sources of protein, encourages optimal protein uptake and absorption over time. This lends itself to improved muscle growth and repair. Creatine Monohydrate (3g): Research has shown that creatine can improve strength, increase lean muscle mass and help muscles recover more quickly during exercise. This muscular boost can help achieve increased bursts of speed and energy, especially during high-intensity activities such as weight lifting or running. Montmorency Cherries (300mg): Variety of sour cherry containing high levels of anthocyanins that have powerful anti-inflammatory properties to help reduce damage from intensive exercise. There is also emerging research looking at how these cherries can offer relief from the pain of arthritis and osteoarthritis. Bilberries (250mg): Belonging to a class of natural bioactives with wide-reaching health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, glucose control and inflammation. These dark berries are rich in antioxidants and resveratrol, which are seeing increased use for their purported anti-aging properties. Magnesium (200mg, 53%*): Contributes to electrolyte balance and normal energy-yielding metabolism. Required to regulate blood pressure, keep bones strong, and the heart rhythm steady. Adults who are deficient in magnesium are more likely to have elevated inflammation markers, which in turn, has been associated with serious health conditions. *%NRV (Nutrient Reference Values) are guidelines on daily amounts of vitamins and minerals to be consumed to maintain a healthy diet.Allergens: Milk (whey). The Power Booster: Creatine Monohydrate (5g): One of the most researched sport supplements on the market. Recommended for athletes and recreational gym goers undertaking high-intensity exercise. Creatine is stored within muscle and plays a crucial role in the production of energy during high- intensity exercise such as sprinting or weightlifting. Allergens: None. The Recover Capsules: Maca (2g): Reduces effects of physical and mental stress, and increases energy and libido. Grown for more than 2,000 years in the highest mountains of Peru, maca has recently found widespread popularity as an adaptogen. These are a group of natural ingredients that support the body's ability to deal with stress. ZMA (300mg): A natural mineral supplement made up of an optimal balance of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Zinc plays a role in supporting normal testosterone levels. Magnesium plays a role in metabolism and muscle function. Vitamin B6 reduces tiredness and may help boost energy levels. Chocamine (120mg): A cocoa extract high in flavanols, a group of natural bioactives. An early study on epicatechin (the main sirt activator in cocoa) found that it reduced myostatin (a protein secreted in muscle tissues) and increased follistatin which promotes muscle growth. Ubiquinone CoQ10 (50mg): A nutrient essential for the optimal functioning of our mitochondria – the energy producing factories of our bodies. This vitamin-like compound is made in the body and used by our cells to produce energy for growth and repair. Research suggests that we don’t get enough of it and levels drop as we get older. Selenium (100ug): An essential trace mineral best known as an antioxidant needed for a strong immune system, and playing a role in male and female fertility. Research suggests that increased selenium intake may lead to reduced cancer risk. Selenium deficiency, notably in Western countries, is increasing the call for its supplementation. Vitamin D (500IU, 250%*): Regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. While there are early suggestions that vitamin D supplementation could provide some protection against COVID-19, more trials are needed before this can be confirmed. Regardless, it would be a good idea to achieve your recommended daily intake given the overall health risks of vitamin D deficiency. *%NRV (Nutrient Reference Values) are guidelines on daily amounts of vitamins and minerals to be consumed to maintain a healthy diet.Allergens: None.

          "description": "Strength simplified. Three single-serve pouches of The Strong Protein in vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. Ideal for when you're travelling or on-the-go. The Strong Protein is our whey protein powder for muscle growth. Per Serving: Protein (34g): The building block of bones, muscles, hair, skin, and nails, this blend of dairy-based whey concentrate and isolate contains all the essential amino acids your body needs for repair, recovery and muscle development. References >1, 2. Casein: A slower-digesting protein that, when combined with faster-digesting sources of protein, encourages optimal protein uptake and absorption over time. This lends itself to improved muscle growth and repair. References > 3, 4. Creatine Monohydrate (3g): Research has shown that creatine can improve strength, increase lean muscle mass and help muscles recover more quickly during exercise. This muscular boost can help achieve increased bursts of speed and energy, especially during high-intensity activities such as weight lifting or running. References > 5, 6. Montmorency Cherries (300mg): A sour cherry containing high levels of anthocyanins that have powerful anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce damage that may occur during exercise. There is also increasing amounts of research looking at how they can offer relief from arthritis and osteoarthritis. References > 7, 8. Bilberries (250mg): Belonging to a class of natural bioactives with wide-reaching health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, glucose control and inflammation. These dark berries are rich in antioxidants and resveratrol, which are seeing increased use for their purported anti-aging properties. References > 9, 10. Magnesium (200mg, 53%*): An important mineral that contributes to electrolyte balance and normal energy-yielding metabolism. It is required to regulate blood pressure, keep bones strong, and the heart rhythm steady. Adults who are deficient in magnesium are more likely to have elevated inflammation markers, which in turn, has been associated with serious health conditions. References > 11, 12. *%NRV (Nutrient Reference Values) are guidelines on daily amounts of vitamins and minerals to be consumed to maintain a healthy diet.

This product is vegetarian, cruelty free, gluten free, soy free, halal, suitable for kosher diets, non-GMO, and free from most major allergens. Furthermore, the product contains no artificial fillers, bulking agents or colours, and our packaging is 100% recyclable. The protein in this product is sourced from whey (milk); a complete source of protein containing all the amino acids your body needs. We've added guar gum, which is a GMO-free, gluten-free, natural fibre that comes from the guar bean to give our shakes a creamy texture. We use sunflower lecithin instead of soy lecithin, which is the only kind of lecithin that can be obtained raw and chemical-free using a cold press system similar to that used with olive oil. We also add some sweetness to the product by adding a tiny bit of sucralose, which is the most widely tested low-calorie sweetener and approved by all food standard agencies in the world.
