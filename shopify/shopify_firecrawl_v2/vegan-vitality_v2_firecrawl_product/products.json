As fish get their Omega 3 from Algae, our Algae oil cuts out this unsustainable and unnecessary waste of life. NO FISHY SMELL: Studies have show that many fish oils are rancid. Our Omega 3 is 100% pure and doesn't smell funny or leave a nasty aftertaste. SIMILAR BENEFITS AS REGULAR FISH OIL, BUT WITHOUT THE FISH!: 100% VEGAN: Vegan Vitality Algae Oil is 100% vegetable based and grown in a 100% contamination free environment. SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE TO FLAXSEED: Studies have shown that the chemical structure of Omega 3 from Flaxseed doesn't transform into nutrients as easily as Algae oil. 400mg DHA PER CAPSULE & 2 MONTHS SUPPLY: Our super concentrated capsules offer some of the highest quantities of Omega 3 per capsule available, more than you will find in many other algae oil products and offer 2 months supply. Ingredients: Active: 100% vegan algae oil (50% DHA), Vitamin E (dl-Alpha-Tocopheryl Acetate).Softgel Capsule: Cassava Starch (non-GMO), Vegetable Glycerine (from soybeans), Purified Water.
