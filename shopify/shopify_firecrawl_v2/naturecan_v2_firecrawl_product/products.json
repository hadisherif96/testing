Perfect for all who want to support cellular energy, overall health and well-being, our NMN supplement should be a staple in your everyday routine. What is NMN Supplement? NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide) is a naturally occurring molecule, known as a nucleotide, that helps power your body. Playing many roles, NMN acts as the building block of our DNA, aiding DNA repair, promoting NAD levels, playing the role of a metabolism booster, energy production and much more. What is NMN for? NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) is primarily researched for its potential health benefits related to healthy ageing and cellular energy. Health-wise, NMN is thought to: Support Cellular Health: NMN may help in maintaining healthy cellular function by promoting the production of NAD levels (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), an essential molecule involved in energy production and cellular metabolism. Enhance Energy Metabolism: By potentially increasing NAD levels, NMN might support energy metabolism, providing cells and skeletal muscle with the energy needed for various biological processes. Promote Anti-ageing Effects: Some studies conducted human trials, which suggest that NMN could have anti-ageing properties by supporting genome stability and promoting the activity of sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity. Support Cognitive Function: There is interest in NMN's potential to support brain health and cognitive function, possibly by enhancing neuronal energy availability. Improve Cardiovascular Health: Preliminary research indicates NMN might support cardiovascular health by improving vascular function and promoting healthy blood flow. Supports insulin sensitivity: a recent study discovered that NMN enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity and restores gene expression related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm. Hence, NMN may be an important supplement for those living with PCOS or Diabetes. It's important to note that while initial research is promising, more comprehensive NMN studies are needed to fully understand the extent of NMN's health benefits and its effectiveness. As we age, levels of NAD+ in the body naturally decline, which can impact cellular function, energy production, and even the body's ability to repair DNA. NMN works by helping to replenish NAD+ levels, supporting mitochondrial health, and promoting better energy production at the cellular level. This may have the potential to combat the signs of ageing, improve metabolism, and even support cognitive function. NMN Breakthroughs & most interesting study explored A new 2024 study shows that NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) supplementation prolongs the lifespan of prematurely aged mice and protects colon function in ageing mice. In this ground-breaking study, NMN emerges as a possible pathway to promote longevity and minimise the effects of ageing . In conclusion, the results strongly suggest that NMN supplementation offers great potential for promoting healthy ageing in the gut. NMN Benefits explained: What this means for you The NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) benefits mentioned above means that by taking one of our brand new NMN supplements daily, you may receive the potential benefits of improved cellular energy, cellular repair, supported cognitive function and brain health, improved heart health and anti-ageing effects. NMN supplements can benefit a wide range of people; individuals over the age of 40, when NAD+ levels naturally begin to decline, may see the most significant effects, as boosting NAD+ can improve cellular function and vitality. Active individuals seeking increased endurance or those experiencing cognitive fatigue could also benefit from NMN's potential to support brain function and reduce age-related decline. Additionally, people focused on anti-ageing and longevity may use NMN in attempt to help maintain youthful energy and skin health. How much NMN should I take? Simply take one 500 mg NMN capsule per day whatever time suits your needs best. Looking to upgrade your everyday supplement draw?

Can I take NMN and resveratrol together? Yes, NMN and resveratrol may be taken together, as they may complement each other in promoting cellular health. Resveratrol, a natural antioxidant, may activate sirtuins, the proteins linked to longevity. Together, they may be able to enhance the body‚Äôs natural repair mechanisms, potentially aiding in healthy ageing. However, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, as individual needs and responses can vary. How to take NMN? The best time to take NMN is in the morning or early afternoon, as it can help boost energy levels throughout the day. It's also advisable to take NMN on an empty stomach or with a light meal to optimise absorption, although some people may prefer to take it with food to minimise any potential stomach discomfort. Consistency is key, so it's important to take NMN daily for the best results, and you should consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions. Can I take NMN and resveratrol together? Yes, NMN and resveratrol may be taken together, as they may complement each other in promoting cellular health. NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, supports NAD+ production, a coenzyme essential for cellular energy and ageing processes. Resveratrol, a natural antioxidant, may activate sirtuins, the proteins linked to longevity. Together, they may be able to enhance the body‚Äôs natural repair mechanisms, potentially aiding in healthy ageing. However, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, as individual needs and responses can vary.

Perfect for muscle and bone support and increased nutrient needs, this unique formula features three clinically proven ingredients, supported by 15 studies. Discover the power of our brand-new Collagen Peptides Powder at Naturecan. With added Vitamin C to support normal collagen formation¬π, this essential protein helps maintain the health of your skin, muscles, bones, and joints. As we age, natural collagen production declines ‚Äì but our hydrolysed collagen peptides are here to help. Hydrolysis breaks collagen down into smaller peptides for enhanced absorption and bioavailability. What are collagen peptides? Collagen peptides are a form of collagen protein that has been hydrolysed, meaning it has been broken down into smaller peptides. These peptides may be easier for the body to absorb and utilise. Types of Collagen in Our Formula Each peptide complex contains low molecular weight collagen peptides, optimised for bioavailability. Our collagen peptides are Type I and Type III only. Type I Collagen The most abundant collagen type in the human body, Type I collagen, provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments. It plays a critical role in maintaining skin firmness, elasticity, and strength. From your twenties onward, natural production declines, contributing to signs of ageing. Type III Collagen Often found alongside Type I, Type III collagen is important for the structure of skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. It provides elasticity and flexibility, especially in tissues that need to expand and contract. Together, Types I and III form a strong, supportive framework for youthful, resilient skin. Naturecan's Collagen Peptides ‚Äì Scientifically Supported Benefits At Naturecan, our Collagen Peptides Powder is formulated with three clinically studied bioactive collagen complexes ‚Äì TENDOFORTE¬Æ, FORTIGEL¬Æ, and VERISOL¬Æ ‚Äì each designed to target specific areas of the body to support strength, mobility, and skin vitality. TENDOFORTE¬Æ TENDOFORTE¬Æ is enriched with bioactive collagen peptides that support the strength, stability, and elasticity of tendons and ligaments. These connective tissues are vital for movement, flexibility, and injury prevention ‚Äì particularly in physically active individuals. Science spotlight:Pre-clinical trials suggest that daily intake of TENDOFORTE¬Æ may improve tendon quality and reduce the risk of injury, especially when combined with resistance training. While early results are promising, the sample size in initial studies was limited (~20 participants), and further research is encouraged to validate these effects at scale. FORTIGEL¬Æ FORTIGEL¬Æ is a hydrolysed collagen peptide blend specifically developed to support joint and cartilage health. These peptides are optimised to be absorbed and accumulate in articular cartilage, where they may help stimulate cellular activity and contribute to cartilage maintenance. Science spotlight: Clinical studies show FORTIGEL¬Æ may support cartilage regeneration and joint function in individuals with osteoarthritis or joint discomfort. While these findings are compelling, they are primarily based on populations with existing joint issues, and further studies in healthy active adults are ongoing. VERISOL¬Æ VERISOL¬Æ is a patented collagen peptide complex tailored for skin health and beauty. Its unique peptide profile is designed to stimulate the body‚Äôs own collagen production, helping to enhance skin elasticity, improve structure, and promote a smoother, firmer appearance. Science spotlight: In a placebo-controlled study, women aged 35‚Äì55 who took VERISOL¬Æ daily for four weeks showed significant improvements in skin elasticity compared to placebo. Additional research indicates benefits in hydration and wrinkle reduction. As with all early-stage studies, sample sizes were modest (~69 participants), but the results are encouraging. Micronutrients Explained Our Collagen Peptides Powder provides the foundation for skin and tissue support ‚Äì but we go further. We've enriched our formula with three essential micronutrients: Vitamin C, Zinc, and Copper ‚Äì each playing a unique role in supporting your body from the inside out. Zinc Zinc is a vital mineral for skin integrity, hair strength, and nail health. However, research suggests that many adults don‚Äôt meet daily zinc needs ‚Äì particularly men over 35 and athletes with higher nutrient demands. Zinc contributes to: The maintenance of normal skin¬≤ The maintenance of normal hair‚Å¥ The maintenance of normal nails‚Åµ Including zinc in your daily routine helps support your skin barrier and overall appearance ‚Äì from head to toe. Vitamin C Vitamin C plays a direct role in collagen synthesis, making it a natural ally in skin, joint, and bone health. Although common in the diet, it‚Äôs water-soluble and has a short half-life, meaning regular intake is crucial ‚Äì especially during periods of stress, exercise, or illness. Vitamin C contributes to: Normal collagen formation for the function of skin¬π, teeth‚Å∂, bones‚Å∑, and cartilage‚Å∏ By supporting collagen production, Vitamin C helps maintain elasticity and structural strength throughout your body. Copper Often overlooked, copper is essential for connective tissue integrity. While most people meet the basic daily intake, physically active individuals may require more, due to increased mineral loss through sweat. Copper contributes to: The maintenance of normal connective tissues‚Åπ To address this need, our formula includes a precisely balanced level of copper to help support your active lifestyle.

Discover our special bundle with an exclusive discount: üõí View NMN + Resveratrol+ NAC Bundle Product Overview Explore our latest Resveratrol & Rosemary supplement, now available in our Naturecan collection! Our Resveratrol supplement aims to support cardiovascular health and overall vitality. Integrating our Resveratrol capsules into your daily routine is an exceptional decision for those seeking to elevate their path to wellness. What is Resveratrol? Resveratrol is a natural compound found in plants like grapes and berries. Known for its antioxidants, it may promote heart health, boost immunity, and potentially extend lifespan by activating longevity genes and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It's also studied for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to enhance insulin sensitivity, offering promising health benefits. What are our Resveratrol & Rosemary supplements for? Resveratrol is primarily researched for its potential health benefits related to overall health and wellness. According to a 2020 study, Resveratrol is thought to: Protect against diverse chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases Resveratrol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties Neuroprotective, and cardiovascular protective effects May protect against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease It's important to note that while initial research is promising, more comprehensive studies of resveratrol are needed to fully understand the extent of Resveratrol‚Äôs health benefits and its effectiveness. Resveratrol Breakthroughs & most interesting study explored Several studies have suggested that drinking red wine (containing resveratrol through red grapes and berries) can help slow down age-related cognitive decline. However, you would need to drink a substantial amount of red wine in order to get a beneficial amount of resveratrol in your system. This is of course, not advisable. Furthermore, resveratrol seems to interfere with protein fragments called beta-amyloids, which are crucial to forming the plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease Additionally, the compound may set off a chain of events that protects brain cells from damage. Resveratrol vs NMN? Resveratrol and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) supplements differ mainly in their sources and forms. Resveratrol is a natural antioxidant found in grapes, berries, and red wine, often extracted for its potential cardiovascular benefits. Conversely, NMN, involved in energy production and metabolic processes, is generally synthesised in laboratories due to its minimal natural occurrence in foods like broccoli. While Resveratrol is sourced directly from plants and utilised for its health-promoting properties, NMN is produced to enhance NAD+ levels in the body, addressing age-related decline and metabolic issues. Can you take resveratrol and NMN together? Yes you can combine resveratrol and NMN together. Both of our supplements can be used in combination to enhance their potential benefits, supporting health and longevity. Resveratrol, found in red wine and berries, is known for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Whereas, MNM plays a role in cellular energy production, along with the repairing process. Hence, taking them together may enhance their effects on cellular health, energy, and possibly the ageing process. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure safety and appropriateness for your health needs. Rosemary Benefits explained: What this means for you Rosemary, beyond its culinary charm, offers a myriad of benefits, enriching both cuisine and health alike. This fragrant herb brims with antioxidants, can potentially cells from oxidative stress and bolstering immunity. Its potential anti-inflammatory properties may ease discomfort and promote joint health. Rosemary‚Äôs aroma invigorates the mind, enhancing focus and memory. Rich in nutrients like iron and calcium, it fortifies bones and supports blood circulation. Recent studies, such as a 2021 review suggests it may also aid digestion and even alleviate stress, fostering overall well-being.

      "description": "Boost your well-being with Naturecan's NMN and Resveratrol! Specially designed to support energy and longevity, this powerful combination goes beyond conventional supplements by pairing two scientifically backed ingredients known for their potential to combat ageing and promote cellular health. Elevate your daily wellness with this advanced NMN + Resveratrol formula when your body needs it most. Key Benefits: 500mg NMN per capsule 500mg Resveratrol per capsule Premium capsule technology for optimal absorption Supports energy, longevity, and cardiovascular health Two-month supply in every bundle Suitable for vegans Made in Europe Product Overview Discover the powerful combination of our NMN and Resveratrol supplements, now available at Naturecan! Designed to support cellular health, energy production, and overall vitality, this dynamic duo is the perfect addition to your daily routine for enhanced well-being and longevity. What is Resveratrol? Resveratrol is a natural compound found in plants like grapes and berries, known for its potential antioxidant properties. It may support cardiovascular health, improve immunity, and potentially extend lifespan by activating longevity genes and protecting cells from oxidative stress [1][2]. Additionally,it may have anti-inflammatory benefits and the ability to enhance insulin sensitivity offering promising support for overall wellness. What is NMN? NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide) is a naturally occurring molecule essential for cellular energy and DNA repair. It acts as a precursor to NAD+, a critical molecule that powers metabolism, repairs cells, and supports overall energy production. By boosting NAD+ levels, NMN may play a significant role in promoting healthy aging, improving metabolic health, and enhancing vitality [3][4]. Why Choose the NMN & Resveratrol Bundle? Combining these two scientifically supported supplements offers a comprehensive approach to health and wellness. Together, they may help optimize cellular function, protect against oxidative stress, and support heart and metabolic health, helping you feel and perform at your best every day [3][5]. Why is taking NMN and Resveratrol together often recommended? Taking NMN and Resveratrol together is recommended because they may work synergistically to support cellular health and optimise energy production. NMN is a precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a molecule critical for cellular energy and repair processes, but its effectiveness depends on the activation of specific enzymes like sirtuins. Resveratrol, a natural compound found in foods like red grapes, may activate these sirtuins, potentially enhancing the benefits of NMN. Together, these supplements might contribute to improved mitochondrial function, better metabolic health, and support for healthy aging by promoting cellular repair and vitality more effectively than either supplement alone . NMN and Resveratrol: Unlocking Health Benefits Discover the transformative power of NMN and Resveratrol before and after supplementation, showcasing their combined potential for health and wellness. NMN benefits include supporting cellular energy, promoting DNA repair, and enhancing metabolic health, making it a key player in combating the effects of ageing. Adding this powerful supplement to your routine may help you feel revitalised and balanced. The resveratrol benefits are equally impressive, providing possible antioxidant protection to reduce oxidative stress, supporting cardiovascular health, and activating sirtuins‚Äîproteins associated with longevity. Together, these two supplements work synergistically, potentially amplifying the body‚Äôs natural repair mechanisms and promoting healthy ageing [10]. By observing the impact of NMN and resveratrol before and after use, their ability to improve energy levels, protect cells, and promote vitality becomes clear. Let Naturecan help you take the first step toward optimized wellness today. Is NMN Really Worth It? The potential benefits of NMN, such as improved energy metabolism and possible anti-aging effects, make it a promising supplement for those seeking to enhance their well-being. NMN benefits include supporting cellular energy production, promoting DNA repair, and enhancing metabolic health. While individual results vary, the growing body of research into NMN and Resveratrol highlights their synergistic potential in promoting longevity. Observing the effects of NMN and Resveratrol before and after use may reveal their ability to combat aging and improve vitality. Resveratrol benefits are also compelling. This powerful antioxidant may protect against oxidative stress, support cardiovascular health, and activate sirtuins‚Äîproteins associated with longevity. Together with NMN supplements, resveratrol benefits may enhance the body's natural repair mechanisms, making the combination of NMN + Resveratrol a promising approach for cellular health and energy support. NMN vs. Resveratrol: Which is Right for You? When considering NMN vs Resveratrol, each offers unique benefits for health and well-being, but they serve different purposes. NMN capsules are designed to support cellular energy production, enhance NAD+ levels, and promote DNA repair. Capsules provide a convenient, precise dosing option, protecting NMN from environmental factors and ensuring optimal effectiveness. On the other hand, Resveratrol benefits include its potential antioxidant properties, supporting cardiovascular health, reducing oxidative stress, and activating longevity-related proteins like sirtuins. Unlike NMN, Resveratrol targets different cellular pathways, making it a complementary supplement rather than a direct alternative. Choosing between NMN and Resveratrol depends on your health goals. If you're focused on boosting energy and cellular metabolism, NMN is a great option. For those seeking antioxidant protection and cardiovascular support, Resveratrol benefits are invaluable. For the best of both worlds, combining NMN and Resveratrol can provide synergistic advantages, as their effects may complement each other. Observing the effects of NMN and Resveratrol before and after use can reveal the full potential of this combination for overall vitality and anti-aging benefits.

Our NAC supplements aim to support respiratory health, mental health and overall vitality. Integrating our NAC supplement into your daily routine is an exceptional decision for those seeking to elevate their path to wellness. What is NAC? NAC, which stands for N Acetyl Cysteine, is a supplement form containing the semi-essential amino acid cysteine. It is commonly known as NAC. What is a NAC supplement? When consumed, cysteine transforms, resulting in N Acetyl Cysteine , a potent compound recognised for its antioxidant properties. One of NAC‚Äôs potential benefits lies in its ability to create and replenish glutathione, a potent antioxidant in the human body. The FDA has even approved NAC supplements as a drug to treat acetaminophen poisoning, effectively neutralising toxic acetaminophen metabolites in the liver and preventing acetaminophen overdose. However, the applications of NAC extend far beyond its well-established role in boosting glutathione levels and detoxification. NAC supplement benefits: What this means for you Several studies have suggested that NAC as a supplement may reduce heart disease risk by preventing oxidative damage. This is potentially completed by reducing oxidative damage to tissues in your heart, which can reduce the likelihood of heart disease, strokes, heart attacks and other serious conditions. Furthermore, studies also show that NAC may protect heart function and health in those living with diabetes, along with those recovering from certain heart surgeries. More potential NAC supplement benefits are: Can make the powerful antioxidant glutathione Helps with detoxification to prevent kidney and liver damage May improve mental health conditions Helps relieve symptoms of respiratory conditions Boosts brain health by regulating glutamate and replenishing glutathione May improve fertility in both men and women May stabilise blood sugar boosts glutathione levels may improve immune function NAC powder vs NAC capsules NAC powder vs NAC capsules both offer the benefits of N-Acetylcysteine, but NAC as a supplement is generally more convenient. NAC capsules provide precise dosing, are easy to transport, and avoid the taste issues associated with powder. Capsules eliminate the need for measuring, ensuring consistent intake. They are also typically easier to store and carry, making them ideal for those with busy lifestyles. While NAC powder can be mixed with liquids for customised dosages, it may have an unpleasant taste and requires careful measurement. For most users, NAC as a supplement is a more user-friendly and hassle-free option. How many NAC supplements should I take? Simply take one 600 mg NAC capsule per day at the time that best suits your needs. Looking to upgrade your everyday supplement draw?
